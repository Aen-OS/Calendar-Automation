# Calendar-Automation

Always need to update my calendar so I can keep a schedule and I like being able to have my days planned; less decision-making == more energy. 

I'm muslim, and so I keep up with the five daily prayers - updating them everyday on my calendar is tedious, especially on top of all the other events that I need to put on my calendar. So I looked up how to automatically add events to my calendar, and then added some code to update my calendar with specific prayer times. 
All the code for automating the creation & updating of events is all literally copied from a website I found on google. 

prayer times change day by day so I used beautifulsoup to webscrape the times from a favourite website of mine that show prayer times for the current month.
